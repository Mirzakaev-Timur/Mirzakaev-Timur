# About Me

Welcome to my Github page! ✋

My name is Timur Mirzakaev, and I am a software tester engineer at Lexema Ltd 👨‍💻

My professional experience in testing started in April 2022. I completed a 6-month course in software tester, for which I received a diploma 👨‍🎓

On this page you can see my work completed during the course. My work is presented in the JAVA programming language on automating testing of web applications, as well as work on learning a language for testing🖥

I will be glad if you like my projects!😏
